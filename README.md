# Login Server
This is a simple HTTP server that allows users to log in and perform basic account actions using html forms. A small amount of user data will exist for each user, such as last login time, and a few user designated settings values. This data can then be requested and retrieved by the user when they're logged in. This server handles logins using the LoginManager (LoginServer) library (https://github.com/rseeber/loginServer)
